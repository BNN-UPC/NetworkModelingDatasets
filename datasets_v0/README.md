# Datasets

In this repository you can find the links to download datasets for different network topologies. Each topology corresponds to a compressed file with the following structure:

* *.ned file that describes the network topology and links capacities.

* tfrecords/train: This is the input TFRecords file that contains the samples used to train RouteNet. To generate this training set, we randomly selected 80% of the samples from the original dataset.

* tfrecords/evaluate: This is the TFRecords file used to evaluate RouteNet. It contains a collection of 20% of the samples extracted randomly from the original dataset.

* A compressed file for each simulated routing and traffic intensity. The filenames use the following structure:             
      
      results_<topology_name>_<lambda>_<routing_scheme>.tar.gz

Where <lambda> represents the traffic intensity and <routing_scheme> is an identifier of the routing used in the simulation.

Each compressed file contains the following parameters:

* Routing.txt: The simulated routing schema. The file includes a matrix that describes the destination-based Routing Information Base (RIB) at each node:

      Routing_matrix(src node , dst node) = output port to reach the dst node from the src node.

* params.ini: Some parameters used by the simulator. The most important ones for the user are 'simulationDuration' and 'repeat'. As the name indicates, the simulationDuration is the duration of the simulation. Its value is selected to collect the stadystics onces the newtwork has stabilized and depend on the topology. Some information provided by the simulator like the number of generated packets or droped packets depends on this parameter. 
The repeat parameter indicates the number of simulations done for this routing and traffic intensity. Each simulation use a different traffic matrix.

* simulationResults.txt: Contains the samples generated by our network simulator. This includes a number of input traffic matrices and the resulting performance measured on every source-destination pair of the network (per-packet mean delay and jitter, and number of packets generated and dropped). Each line in the simulationResults.txt files corresponds to a simulation with different traffic matrices probabilistically generated from a given traffic intensity (lambda). We describe below the data structure of each line (i.e., each simulation). Note that in a topology with ‘n’ nodes, nodes are enumerated in the range [0, n-1].
  
  1.- Bandwidth (in kbps) generated for each source-destination pair in the network.
  
         index = (src_node∗n+dst_node)*3
  
  2.- Absolute number of packet generated in each source-destination pair.
  
         index = (src_node∗n+dst_node)*3 + 1
  
  3.- Absolute number of packet losses in each source-destination pair.
  
         index = (src_node∗n+dst_node)*3 + 2
  
  4.- Average delay over the packets transmitted for each source-destination pair in the network. 
  
         index = n*n*3 + (src_node∗n+dst_node)*7  
  
  5.- Percentile 10 over the packets transmitted for each source-destination pair.
  
         index = n*n*3 + (src_node∗n+dst_node)*7 + 1
  
  6.- Percentile 20 over the packets transmitted for each source-destination pair.
  
         index = n*n*3 + (src_node∗n+dst_node)*7 + 2
  
  7.- Percentile 50 over the packets transmitted for each source-destination pair.
  
         index = n*n*3 + (src_node∗n+dst_node)*7 + 3
  
  8.- Percentile 80 over the packets transmitted for each source-destination pair.
  
         index = n*n*3 + (src_node∗n+dst_node)*7 + 4
  
  9.- Percentile 90 over the packets transmitted for each source-destination pair.
  
         index = n*n*3 + (src_node∗n+dst_node)*7 + 5
  
  10.- Variance of the delay (jitter) over the packets transmitted for each source-destination pair.
  
         index = n*n*3 + (src_node∗n+dst_node)*7 + 6
